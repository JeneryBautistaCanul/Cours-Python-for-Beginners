### 5.1 Lesson
#### Exponentiation

Alright, that covers the very basic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You’re doing great!  

It’s time to kick it up a notch and introduce **exponentiation**–which is what we call it when we raise one number to the power of another.  

The exponentiation operation is performed using two asterisks. Like this:
``` Python
print(2 ** 5)
```

> You can chain exponentiations together. In other words, you can rise a number to multiple powers. For example, 2**3**2.

Fill in the blank to output 5 raised to the 3rd power.
``` Python
print(5  3)
```

Too easy? Yeah, thought so. How about exponentiation with floats! Because we can totally use floats in exponentiation.  

Check it out. The following code will result in the square root of 9:
``` Python
print(9 ** (1/2))
```

> the result will be a **float**

What is the output of this code?
``` Python
print(8 ** (1/3))
```
