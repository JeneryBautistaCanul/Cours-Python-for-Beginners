### 4.1 Lesson
#### Data Types

Before we go any further, it’s a good idea to introduce the main types of data that we use in Python. Each value in Python has a **type**.

Text, like "Hello world", is called a **string**.  
Whole numbers are called **integers**.  
And numbers with a decimal point are called **floats**.  

Now, we’ve already encountered strings and integers, so you know what that means...Time to float!

> Some examples of numbers that are represented as **floats** are 0.5 and -7.8237591.

Which of these will be stored as a float?
- 42
- "hey"
- 7.4

#### Floats

So we know what **floats** are, they’re numbers with a decimal, but how do we produce them?

Well, we can produce a float by dividing any two integers.  
Or we can also run an operation on two floats, or on a float and an integer.

Like this:
``` Python
print(8 / 2)
print(6 * 7.0)
print(4 + 1.65)
```

> A float can be added to an integer, because Python automatically converts the integer to a float. Clever Python!

What is the output of this code?
``` Python
print(1 + 2 + 3 + 4.0 + 5)
```
