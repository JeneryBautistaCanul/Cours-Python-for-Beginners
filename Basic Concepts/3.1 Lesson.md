### 3.1 Lesson
#### Simple Operations

So Python can spell, but can it count? Let’s talk about calculations.  
Doing a calculation in Python is simple, just enter it into the **print** statement (don’t forget the parentheses!):
``` Python
print(2 + 2)
print(5 + 4 - 3)
```

> See the spaces around the plus and minus signs? The code would work without them–but they make it a lot easier to read.

What does this code output?
``` Python
print(1 + 2 + 3)
```

Multiplication and division in Python are also pretty simple. We use an __asterisk *__ to multiply and a **forward slash /** to divide.  
Again, we just enter it straight into the **print** statement. Like this:
``` Python
print(10 / 2)
```

Just like in regular math, we can use **parentheses** to indicate the operations we want performed first (but we still need to include the ones around the statement too!). Like this:
``` Python
print(2 * (3 + 4))
```

> Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or **float**, as it’s known in programming). We'll dive into **floats** in the next lesson.

Which option is the output of this code?
``` Python
print((4 + 8) / 2)
```
