#Random task! You need to calculate the number of hours in **888** minutes.

#Your program needs to output the number of hours and then the number of remaining minutes, on separate lines.

#For example, 72 minutes are equal to 1 hour and 12 minutes, so your program would output:
#**1**
#**12**

#Hours
#print(72 // 60)
#Minutes
#print(72 % 60)

#> You can use floor division to find the number of hours, and the modulo operator to find the remaining minutes.
#Use separate print() statements for each output.

#Your code goes here
#Number of hours in 88 minutes
#Hours
print(888 // 60)
#Minutes
print(888 % 60)
