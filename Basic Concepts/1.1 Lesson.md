### 1.1 Lesson
#### Introduction

Welcome to Python!  

Want to build a slick website? Develop a video game? Or maybe create an artificial intelligence? Python’s got you covered, and then some. **Python** is a high-level programming language, with a ton of applications.  
It’s seriously flexible and accessible, which makes it popular with some of the world's biggest (and coolest) organizations–think Google, NASA, Disney...*whispers* even the CIA.  
In this course, we’ll cover the basic concepts of Python, as well as build real-life projects and solve different coding challenges!

> We will be learning **Python version 3**, which is the most recent major version of Python.
