### 6.1 Lesson
#### Quotient & Remainder

##### Quotient

**Floor division** is done using two forward slashes and is used to determine the **quotient** of a division. Wait! What?! "Floor Division"? "Quotient"?

Quotient just means the quantity produced by the division of two numbers.

And Floor division is just like a normal division operation except that it returns the largest possible integer. This integer is either less than or equal to the normal division result.

For example:
``` Python
print(20 // 6)
```

The code above will output 3, because 6 goes into 20 three times, and is the largest possible integer.

> You can also use floor division on floats, and the result will always be a float.

What is the output of this code?
``` Python
print(10 // 4)
```
- 0
- 2
- 3

##### Remainder

Ahh those pesky remainders. But, they’re not so pesky in Python. We can use the **modulo operator**–which is carried out with a percent symbol (%)–to get the **remainder** of a given division.

For example:
``` Python
print(20 % 6)
print(1.25 % 0.5)
```

> All numerical operators can also be used with floats.

What is the result of this code?
``` Python
print(7 % (5 // 2))
```
- 7
- 0
- 1
