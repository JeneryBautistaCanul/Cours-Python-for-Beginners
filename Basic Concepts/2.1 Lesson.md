### 2.1 Lesson
#### Hello World

Let's kick things off by creating a simple program that displays the text "Hello world!".  
In Python, we use the **print** function to output text.  
So to generate our message, the code would look like this:
``` Python
print('Hello world!')
```

Nice work! You’ve just written your first Python program. Easy, right? You’ll be triggering the singularity in no time!

> The **print** statement is always followed by parentheses containing the output we want to generate.

Drag & drop the correct option to output "Learning Python"
``` Python
 ('Learning Python')
```
- print
- output
- write

##### Printing Text

More to say? Of course you do!  
You can use the print statement to output multiple lines of text.  

For Example:
``` Python
print('Hello world!')
print('Hello world!')
print('Spam and eggs...')
```

Each **print** statement will output its text on a new line.

> Python code contains lots of references to **Monty Python**. So you’ll see "spam" and "eggs" used as placeholder variables.

Rearrange the code to generate the following output:
- A
- B
- C
