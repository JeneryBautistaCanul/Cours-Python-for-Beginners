### 11.1 Lesson
#### String Operations

##### Concatenation

In Python math works with words as well as numbers.

So not only can we add integers and floats, but also strings, using something called **concatenation**, which can be done on any two strings. Like this:
``` Python
print("Spam" + 'eggs')
```

And it even works with numbers! Strings containing numbers are still added as strings rather than integers. Like this:
``` Python
print("2" + "2")
```

> But don’t try to add a string to a number! Even though they might look similar, they are two different entities, so doing this will break the code and produce an error.

Fill in the blanks to produce “Python rocks”.
``` Python
print("      " + "     ")
```

##### String Operations

You may not be able to add strings to integers, but you can multiply by them!

Multiplying a string by an integer, produces a repeated version of the original string. Like this:
``` Python
print("spam" * 3)
print(4 * '2')
```

> But don’t try to multiply a string by another string. This will just generate an error. The same will happen if you try to multiply a string by a float, even if the float is a number.

What is output of this code?
``` Python
print(3 * '7')
```
