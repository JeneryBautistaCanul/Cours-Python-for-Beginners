#This code tries to make a triangle out of stars. But oh no! There’s an error in there somewhere-it outputs all the stars on one line, instead of separate lines.

#Fix the code to output a triangle of stars that has 4 rows.
#> You can use **\n** newlines to create line breaks in the string.  
#**Important**: Remove any extra spaces to match the required output.

#Your code goes here
#Triangle out of stars
print("*\n**\n***\n****") #New line
