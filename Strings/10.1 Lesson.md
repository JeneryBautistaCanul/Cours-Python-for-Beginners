### 10.1 Lesson
#### Newlines

Ok, so we can generate text, but it’d be pretty hard to read if everything was on one single line, right?

To create a new line we use **\n**.

\n can be used in strings to create multi-line outputs. Like this:
``` Python
print('One \nTwo \nThree')
```

> Based on what we just learned, can you guess how we  represent tab? That's right, it's **\t**.

Which og the following options results in exactly two lines?
- 'one\'two\'three'
- "Some \n next \n goes here"
- "Hello \n world"
- "Hello world"

**\n** is useful, but it can be a bit of a pain if we’re trying to format lots of multiline text.

There’s another way though! Newlines are automatically added for strings created using **three quotes**.
For example:
``` Python
print("""this
is a
multiline
text""")
```

> This makes it easier to format long, multi-line texts without the need to explicitly put \n for line breaks.

How many lines will the following code output?
``` Python
print("Hi")
print("""This 
is
great""")
```
