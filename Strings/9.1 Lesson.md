### 9.1 Lesson
#### Strings

We met strings in module 1, but now it’s time to get better acquainted.

Simply put, if you want to use text in Python, you have to use a **string**. But there’s a lot more to it than that, as we’ll find out together!

We can create a **string** by entering text between **two single or double quotation marks**. Like this:
``` Python
print("Python is fun!")
print('Always look on the bright side of life')
```

> The delimiter (" or ') used for a string doesn't affect how it behaves in any way.

Drag and drop the correct option to output the string 'Hi there'
``` Python
      ('Hi there )
```
- print
- '
- %
- string
- "

#### Backslash

But what if you want to include a single quote in a single-quoted string (or a double quote in a double-quoted string)? Normally this would confuse Python and break the code, that is unless you escape the quotes using a **backslash**.

For Example:
``` Python
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!')
```

> Backslashes that we use for escaping, don’t get displayed in the output.

Complete the code to output a string containing a single quote.
``` Python
print('I 'm learning!')
```
